<h3>Should Developers Design?</h2>
<p>
   <img src="/img/brain.jpg" class="post-image-left" width="255" height="270"/>
   Two recent articles on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a> hit close to home for me. The first post 
   linked to a <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/habit-list-track-your-goals/id525102168?mt=8">goal-tracking app</a> for 
   iOS that received many positive comments for its very clean and intuitive user interface. The second post was a link 
   to a blog post titled <a href="http://blog.factlink.com/post/23308427848/dont-look-for-a-ux-guy-be-a-ux-guy">
   Don’t look for a UX guy, be a UX guy</a>.
</p>

<p>
   I also have a goal-tracking app for iOS, one that uses default iOS controls, basic fonts/color schemes and focuses 
   on function over form. Guess which one I’m now using on my iPod?
</p>

<p>
   UI/UX is hard to get right and seems mystical to us non-designers. My first instinct is to get code working and tack 
   on the UI so it conforms to the implementation decisions I’ve made. But if empathy for users is the goal, this process 
   is exactly backwards.
</p>

<p>
   I certainly want to improve in this area, but the left side of my brain just doesn’t want to concede any ground to the 
   right side. Why spend time learning design skills when I can learn a new programming language or new web framework?
</p>

<p>
   One resource I have found helpful is <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> from Twitter.
   <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> provides a basic layout template along with several 
   styled controls/icons to use for web development.
</p>

<p>
   Also, at one time or another, I’ve seen the following books recommended for learning UI/UX:
   <p>
   <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/About-Face-Essentials-Interaction-Design/dp/0470084111/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top">About Face 3: The Essentials of Interaction Design</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sketching-User-Experiences-Interactive-Technologies/dp/0123740371/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_S_nC?ie=UTF8&amp;coliid=I2MCUGW50NT4U2&amp;colid=JPDZ0MUWRTIF">Sketching User Experiences: Getting the Design Right and the Right Design</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Designing-Web-Usability-Jakob-Nielsen/dp/156205810X/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_nC?ie=UTF8&amp;coliid=I1CDXWJCE3AMM4&amp;colid=JPDZ0MUWRTIF">Designing Web Usability</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/0321344758/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_nC?ie=UTF8&amp;coliid=I17EOS6M85AV6R&amp;colid=JPDZ0MUWRTIF">Don’t Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability</a></li>
   </ul>
   </p>
</p>


<p>
   Alas, these books still sit in my Amazon wish list unread. I really do want to get to them but first I need to finish 
   that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Erlang-Software-Concurrent-World/dp/193435600X/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1337724144&amp;sr=8-4">book on Erlang</a>, 
   continue experimenting with <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone.js</a> and …
</p>

<p>
   Maybe I’ll just leave design to the experts.
