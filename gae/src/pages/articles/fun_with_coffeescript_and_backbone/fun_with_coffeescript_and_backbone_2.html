<h3>Fun with CoffeeScript and Backbone.js (Part 2)</h3>

<p>
   Part 1 of this series can be read <a href="/articles/fun_with_coffeescript_and_backbone_1">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
   The project is a simplified morse code simulator that animates morse code being sent over a telegraph line. The 
   complete source is available <a href="https://github.com/rmb177/MorseCode">here</a> and the running code can be 
   seen <a href="/doodles/morse_code">here</a>.   
</p>

<p>
   In this post Iâ€™ll discuss the code that handles updating the UI.
</p>

<h5>Communication Line View</h5>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/2886084.js"></script>

<p>
   The CommunicationLineView class is a Backbone.js view class that handles the animation of signals sent across 
   the communication line. In <a href="/articles/fun_with_coffeescript_and_backbone_1">Part 1</a>, I mentioned that 
   the model representing the communication line fires a hasNewData event each time the tokens progress one step through 
   the line. As you can see above, this view is bound to that event and rerenders itself every time it receives the 
   event. The render method iterates over the current tokens and draws the appropriate token shape for each line position.
</p>


<h5>Decoder Model</h5>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/2886116.js"></script>

<p>
   The Decoder model is responsible for determining what characters the user has sent across the line. The 
   processToken function is called each time the tokens on the communication line progress one step through the line. 
   The decoder processes the current tokens sent by the user anytime it sees 10 or more empty tokens in a row or 
   receives a word-break token. If the decoder parses a known morse code sequence it fires a parsedCharacter event 
   letting the message field know it needs to rerender itself.
</p>

<h5>Decoder View</h5>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/2886198.js"></script>

<p>
   The Decoder view is a Backbone.js view class that represents a simple text box to display the characters the 
   user has sent across the line. Anytime the Decoder model emits a parsedCharacter event, the Decoder view appends 
   the parsed character to the end of its text box.
